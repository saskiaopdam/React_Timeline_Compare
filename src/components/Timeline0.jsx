        <h3>1. Website</h3>
        <p>April 2021</p>
        <p>First Winc Academy front-end assignment.</p>
        <p>
          I learned how to make a website using a mobile-first approach and
          semantic HTML, and received useful feedback on how to apply the right
          indentation and to neatly organise all files. The website had to cover
          a clearly outlined topic and to contain multiple pages, images and a
          form. We had to demonstrate understanding of the box-model and use
          flexbox or grid for positioning.

        <p>
          Code to design, applying Sass and BEM principle. The challenge with
          the testimonial was to position the image correctly and recreate the
          design of the example as closely as possible.

        <p>
          Code to design, applying Sass and BEM principle. The challenge with

          Code to design, applying Sass and BEM principle. The challenge with

        <h3>3. Colour toggle</h3>
        <p>April 2021</p>
        <p>Third Winc Academy front-end assignment.</p>
        <p>
          I learned how to add interactivity to a website by adding
          eventlisteners to html elements, and received useful feedback on how
          to reduce repetition in javascript and css code. The challenge was to
          create a clickable hamburger with a toggle function, making a colour
          menu visible on first click, and letting it dissapear on the next.
          Also, the menu had to become visible when hovering over the hamburger.
          Additional interactivity comprised change of background colour
          matching the colour selected in the menu.

        <h3>4. Colour toggle design</h3>
        <p>June 2021</p>
        <p>A project of my own.</p>
        <p>
          Inspired by the Colour Toggle assignment, I wanted to create a fun
          version of it, using a bright picture in the background. This time,
          the chosen colour shines through from behind the image of a painted
          wall, giving the website a red, orange, purple or greenish hue. It was
          quite a adventure to create a playful design and position all elements
          correctly.

        <h3>5. Movie filter</h3>
        <p>June 2021</p>
        <p>Fourth Winc Academy front-end assignment.</p>
        <p>
          I learned how to work with arrays, apply array methods like .filter()
          and display data by adding elements to the DOM. In the feedback I was
          a complimented for chosing clear method names, and received the tip to
          use arrow functions. In this project, we had to present a movie list
          and provide five different filter options in the form of radio
          buttons. When clicking on a film poster, the user had to be lead to
          the corresponding page on imdb.com. The focus lay on functionality and
          javascript, styling was a bonus requirement.

        <h3>6. To do list</h3>
        <p>August 2021</p>
        <p>Fifth Winc Academy front-end assignment.</p>
        <p>
          I gained basic understanding of asynchronous javascript and practiced
          with fetching data from an API. This project required including fetch
          requests (get, post, put and delete) in an API client, and providing
          the user with the options to add, edit and delete a task after the to
          do list has loaded. Also, I learned how to implement error handling in
          case something would go wrong with the fetch request.*
        </p>
        <p>
          * Because of the data being fetched from localhost, Netlify displays
          'failed to fetch'. Therefore, I uploaded a previous version without
          error handling and edit option. Both versions are on GitHub.
